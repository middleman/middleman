      | build/should_be_ignored.html  |
      | build/should_be_ignored2.html |
      | build/should_be_ignored3.html |
    And app "clean-app" is using config "complications"
    Given a successfully built app at "clean-app" with flags "--clean"
    Then the following files should not exist:
      | build/should_be_ignored.html  |
      | build/should_be_ignored2.html |
      | build/should_be_ignored3.html |
