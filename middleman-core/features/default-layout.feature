  Scenario: Normal Template
    When I go to "/index.html"
    Then I should see "In Index"
    And I should see "In Layout"

  Scenario: Normal Template with override
    When I go to "/about.html"
    Then I should see "In About"
    And I should see "Second Layout"
    And I should not see "In Layout"

  Scenario: Sass
    When I go to "/style.css"
    Then I should see "border: 1"
    And I should not see "In Layout"

  Scenario: Sass with extension
    When I go to "/style2"
    Then I should see "border: 2"
    And I should not see "In Layout"

  Scenario: JSON
    When I go to "/data.json"
    Then I should see "hello"
    And I should not see "In Layout"

  Scenario: JS
    When I go to "/script.js"
    Then I should see "helloWorld()"
    And I should not see "In Layout"

  Scenario: XML
    When I go to "/test.xml"
    Then I should see "<test>Hi</test>"
    And I should see "<title>Second Layout</title>"
