### Layout

> CSS, by its very nature, is used to lay elements out on the page. However, there is a distinction between layouts dictating the major and minor components of a page. The minor components—such as a callout, or login form, or a navigation item—sit within the scope of major components such as a header or footer. I refer to the minor components as Modules [...] The major components are referred to as Layout styles.

Use this directory for files that contain the CSS to layout major elements on the page. We typically use one file per major component and `@import` them in `style.css.scss`.
