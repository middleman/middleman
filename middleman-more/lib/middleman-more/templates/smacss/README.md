# SMACSS type starter template for Middleman

If you use [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/), you can download this fileset to use as a starting point for new projects. This is inspired by Jonathan Snook's [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) ideas, workshop and book.

## How to use

1. Download files and copy smacss into 
```
~/.middleman/ 
```
(you'll need to create the folder .middleman folder if it doesn't already exist).
2. Initialize a new middleman project with the template flag 
```
middleman init my_new_smacss_project --template=smacss
```

You can read more about project templates on the [Middleman site](http://middlemanapp.com/getting-started/welcome/).
