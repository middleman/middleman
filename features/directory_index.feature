    Then "leave_me_alone.html" should exist at "indexable-app" and include "Stay away"
    Then "regular/index.html" should exist at "indexable-app" and include "Regular"
    Then "regular/index/index.html" should not exist at "indexable-app"
    Then "needs_index.html" should not exist at "indexable-app"
